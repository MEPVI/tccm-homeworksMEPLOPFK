# TCCM Homework: Molecular Dynamics Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation using Fortran.

## Directory Structure
- `src`: Contains source files for the program (e.g., MD_functions.f90).
- `tests`: Contains test files to ensure the program behaves as expected.
- `data`: Example input data for testing the program.
- `LICENSE`: License for the project.
- `AUTHORS`: List of contributors.
- `README.md`: Project description.
- `INSTALL.md`: Instructions to install and run the program.

## Features
- Calculates distances between atoms
- Computes the Lennard-Jones potential for atomic interactions
- Simulates motion using the Verlet integration algorithm
- Outputs trajectories in XYZ format for visualization

## Requirements
- Fortran compiler (e.g., GFortran or Intel Fortran Compiler)
- Operating system: macOS/Linux/Windows (with a Fortran toolchain)

## How to Run
See `INSTALL.md` for installation and running instructions
